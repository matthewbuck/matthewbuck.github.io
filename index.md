# Hello World!

<p> I'm a fourth year medical student at [@QUMedicine](https://twitter.com/QUMedicine) and a research fellow in Urology Quality Improvement & Health Services and Clinical Outcomes [@Yale_Urology](https://twitter.com/Yale_Urology). </p>

<p> I'm excited about understanding and improving outcomes for patients with urologic cancers. I'm a fan of `RStats` and learning more about causal inference and Bayesian statistics. </p>
